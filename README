BasketballWorld - a forum for basketball related discussion
***M3.5***
BasketballWorld is now connected to MongoDB Atlas cloud database.
A user can now login, logout, make posts, make threads, and research shoes.
Testing scripts have been added.
We have added modules to increase cohesion in the router files.


***M3***
We satisfied the 'Create Thread' and 'Sign Up' user stories
By navigating to the Threads button you can view created threads, and add to them with the 'make a post' button
You can sign up and the login data will persist. The data entered is sanitized to be a correct email format,
confirm password field and password field are checked to be the same.

To run make sure to follow the DB setup from the lab3
Run the DB Setup locally
Then launch the project through in webstorm
Go to localhost:3000 in any web browser when it is live

TSLint is used for static code analysis
Travis is used for automated tests on every build

PROBLEMS FACED THIS ITERATION:
There were many. The worst being that we couldnt get the cloud mongo db setup and went instead with the local db
setup, we hope to go back to the cloud by M3.5. Learning all of the new languages was a challenge. It is difficult
to plan or do any high level decision making effectively when you are doing and learning something completely new.
